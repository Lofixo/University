1) Target user profile
There are two main types of people that could look at this project: hiring managers and networking contacts.

At the forefront of the audience stand the employers and hiring managers. These gatekeepers of job opportunities seek candidates who are not only qualified but also an excellent fit for their organization. When they’ll land in this CV project, they’ll have specific expectations in mind:

They expect a CV that is well-structured and comprehensive. They're looking for educational qualifications, work experiences, and a clear demonstration of skills. An easy-to-navigate, detailed CV will pique their interest.

Next up are networking contacts, which mainly look for CVs to facilitate job referrals and professional connections. Their main points of interest are the clarity, professionalism, shareability and value reference.

They often seek to connect with individuals who share their professional interests or have the potential to collaborate on projects, research, or other endeavors. They use CVs to gauge whether a candidate's background aligns with their goals.


2) Information architecture
My CV project consists of a single page divided in three main sections, giving specific information about myself: the header, the main info and the side info.

The header: here is where you’ll find the general details about me: name, occupation, ways to get into contact, and picture (in this case I left “</>” as a placeholder).

The main info: the subject of the matter starts here, talking a bit about myself, what I’m seeking in a job and what I’m willing to provide going into it. You’ll also find my most recent studies as well as the place where I have or am taking them, and finally a couple certificates I got back in the day.

The side info: this is the last section of the CV, where my level on a few general skills regarding my studies are displayed as well as my ability to perform in the languages shown.


3) Visual design
Before starting the project, I decided to browse online a couple CVs to get a sense on what key information was needed and getting a feel on different ways to implement it in a certain layout.

After searching for a bit, I decided to take a white and blue palette approach making use of different shades of blue to create contrast between the elements present in the project. When it comes to typography I personally used a mix of two fonts “IBM Plex Mono” as well as “Secular One”, using the first mainly for text and the latter as titles.

In terms of layout I ended up creating are the three sections mentioned before: the header, the main info and the side info.
Both the header and titles are using the more light blueish color, while the side info’s background is a darker version of it in order to create contrast as well as being able to see the shape of the header section itself.

On top of that we can see some parallelism being formed from the line dividing the main and side info sections, where we can see titles on both sides are on the same height and distance apart from one another.
